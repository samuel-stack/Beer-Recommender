       " '10': 'Both my girlfriend, and a good friend of mine, sent that article about DFH from the New Yorker to me. Of course I had already read it via BeerAdvocate, but appreciated the gestures nonetheless. So when I saw this on the shelf in downtown Vancouver last month, I procured a bottle for each of them (to share with me, of course). The first one vanished none too slowly, so I had better write this one down...\\n\\nThis beer pours a deep, dark black, with reddish tints, and a single finger of tan head, that disappears readily. The smell is prunes, dates, and an intense wood essence, that I admit I cannot identify (beyond the description on the label). The taste is floral hops, heavy black fruit, caramel, vanilla, and an acrid woodiness, again hard to describe. The carbonation is quite low, and the finish carries on the heavy woody sweetness. The body is very thick and viscous, with obvious alcohol warming. It sticks to the palate, making this a slow, if exotically tasty tipple.\\xa0',\n",
       " '11': \"I've never had a 4-pack to come wiht a CD before. I thought I was getting a deal with Left Hand 6-packs with the free sticker. Our homebrew club recently brewed an Imperial Brown and aged it in a Four Roses Bourbon Barrel for the '08 NHC. Interesting to compare the differences. This beer surely qualifies for a Double Brown without loosing any balance, falling into Porter or Stout territory. A nice chocolaty, nutty flavor with a hearty helping of malt, sweetness, and berry-like esters. Good hopping rates give the beer a grassy, piney flavor while offsetting the heavy sweetness. The wood gives a well-roundness to the flavors, but don't give a whole lot of wood flavor or astringency. Quite delicate in it's balance, despite a dominant alcohol (ethanol)taste and slightly harsh textures, but does thin the weighted brew a bit. Surprised to see a fizzy head formation that didn't last any time at all, nor did the carbination -- strange for DFH.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '12': \"Another Dogfish head beer. Hmm. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with botled on date 02/02/2011B. What does the B mean? I don't know. Served into a De Molen beer stemflute in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. I don't know what to expect, but when I think of a brown think nuts. Wood aging isn't anywhere near what I'd expect, and I'm hoping it'll blow me away. Served slightly warmer than refrigerator cold. \\n\\nA: Pours a 1.5 finger head of rich light tan colour, good cream, great thickness, and very impressive retention - especially considering the 12.00% ABV. Wow. Colour is a solid black (NOT brown). I'm impressed so far, and excited to try it. \\n\\nSm: A moderately strong aroma of cream, wood, nuts, birch, vanilla, caramel, and a hint of alcohol. I wouldn't call it subtle, nor is it particularly inviting. No yeast comes through. \\n\\nT: The wood comes through, but only on the finish. The warm alcohol is well-restrained and hidden, hardly coming through at all. I get vanilla, light caramel, very buried roasted barley (why this is buried is beyond me), and nuts - but only on the climax. It isn't subtle, but instead feels muted; I find myself straining to taste each note because the holistic flavour doesn't have all that much to offer. I mean it's good, and it's balanced, but it just doesn't bring the depth or boldness I'd expect from a 12% beer. This may be the least flavorful high ABV beer I've had in the last three months. \\n\\nMf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours and general tone of the beer. Not too thick nor too thin. Actually surprisingly well done. \\n\\nDr: Extremely drinkable for the ABV, but where is the flavour? Hit us with the taste if you believe it's a good one! I like this, but I wouldn't have it again because it's kind of a panzy when it comes to delivering on the promise of the aroma. Shame on you Dogfish Head! \\n\\nB-\\xa0\",\n",
       " '13': 'Bottle from the first release, found in the back of the fridge. \\nLess than a finger of head when poured into a Duchesse goblet. Tan foam that recedes slowly, and leaves a ring. Lactic aroma with some banana ester from the yeast, and slightly roasty. Reminds me of a Bells stout. Rich, creamy feel, earthy roast and lactic taste. Not getting much of the advertised wood-aging. Abv is well disguised. Similar to Bells Kalamazoo Stout or Double Cream. Good, but not worth paying a premium for.\\xa0',\n",
       " '14': \"Poured from a bottle into my Chimay goblet. This bottle has been in my cellar for a year.\\n\\nAppearance: Pours almost black with some red at the edges where the light comes through. There is a half finger of tan head that fades quickly.\\n\\nSmell: Sweet, which isn't surprising. Dark fruit and brown sugar notes. Mild roast and a hint of wood. Some alcohol as well.\\n\\nTaste: Extremely smooth given the abv. Not very sweet, but there are hints of dark fruit and chocolate. The palo santo wood adds some complexity. The finish is still a bit hot even with a year on it.\\n\\nMouthfeel: The body is on the thick side of medium body. The carbonation is fluffy and smooth. The finish is mildly slick.\\n\\nOverall: The fact that this isn't overly sweet really surprised me. I thought it was complex and very interesting. The year of aging was good for this beer, but it is still a bit hot.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '15': \"Appearance: Looks almost like a RIS, although the color might be a tone or two lighter as ruby highlights clearly burst through; the head fades quickly to an espresso cap and leaves a few dots and dashes of lace around the glass\\n\\nSmell: Complex aromas from a variety of sources, including dark fruit, fusel alcohol, molasses and chocolate and, of course, a heavy dose of smokey wood esters\\n\\nTaste: Opens with a rich black bread and caramel/vanilla flavor that moves in a dark fruit and smokey, woody direction by mid-palate, with a bit a black currant jam providing additional sweetness; after the swallow, the chocolate and coffee flavors enter and provide a roasty bitterness that counters the sweet flavors that dominated earlier in the taste profile; the smokey wood sticks around long after the finish\\n\\nMouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; clearly some warmth from the high abv as well\\n\\nDrinkability: I love Dogfish Head's experimental efforts and this beer is among the best they have released, if not the best\\xa0\",\n",
       " '2': 'A: two finger milk chocolate head on a jet black body which poured out like oil.\\n\\nS: vanilla, caramel, toffee, butter, earthy hops and wood all prevail with a boozy undertone.\\n\\nT: I was expecting the worst but this one was as boozy as I was expecting from the 12% ABV. Starts with vanilla and caramel moving to wood then a chocolate and roasted malt finish with dryness provided by mildly bitter coffee. \\n\\nM: thick and oily with moderate carbonation.\\n\\nOverall: the booze are well hidden. This one is actually well balanced. I think the wood cleans this one up and smooths it up.\\xa0',\n",

Also, a whiskey-like flavor.\\n\\nM - It was crisp, yet soft as it warmed. A medium-bodied beer.\\n\\nD - Despite the high ABV, this is a fairly easy-drinking beer. One of the more unique brown ales that I've ever had.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '21': 'Bottle courtesy of Jay23: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing. Aroma of vanilla and oak is pretty pleasant with some light roasted malt notes. Taste is a mix between some roasted malt notes with a mix of vanilla and oak and some creamy lactose notes. Full creamy body is really enjoyable with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done and probably one of the best new seasonal from Dogfish.\\xa0',\n",
       " '22': '12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2012. Pours almost pitch black color with a small foamy dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the small head. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, fig, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, light char, wood, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and wood aging notes. Taste of big raisin, fig, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, light char, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of very robust dark malt flavors with fruitiness; and hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial brown ale. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.\\xa0',\n",
       " '23': \"Appearance - Nearly opaque dark brown with a creamy cap of coffee-colored foam.\\n\\nSmell - Molasses, vanilla, maple syrup. Slightly burnt toast. Sweet without being cloying.\\n\\nTaste & mouthfeel - Rich roasty malt, vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate. The mouthfeel is chewy, almost like a liquid molasses cookie. Quite a bit of subtle complexity; I've had this a couple of times now and I'm still not entirely sure how to describe it. A nice toasty bitterness in the finish balances the initial sweetness. This is a true imperial brown - it retains the character of a brown ale without ever dipping into stout territory. Remarkably drinkable for 12%. A solid DFH offering.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '24': ' abv american brown ale :) This beer has a year or two of age on it.\\n\\nPoured into Bud American Ale glass\\n\\nPours 1/2 finger of mocha tan head. Fades to a thin olater and leaves some slight splattered lace. Color is black, not brown haha. \\n\\nAroma: Huge malt aroma. Lots of oak, vanilla, and caramel. Some raisins and cherries. Damn, this is smelling fine. Very complex.\\n\\nTaste: This hardly tastes like a brown ale. Lots of oak and vanilla. Some caramel and dark fruits. An amazing brown ale. This is one of the tops in the category for me. Aging it was a good idea.\\n\\nMouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, and simply wonderful. Medium to full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Hardly any heat with this beer which is great. Only downfall is that it ends fairly dry.\\n\\nOverall, this beer is great. Tons of flavor. This is a new favorite of mine. I will definitely be getting more to cellar. Pretty drinkable and a fine taste to it. I highly recommend.\\xa0',\n",
       " '25': 'A: Pours an opaque jet black in color. The beer has a finger tall tan head that reduces to a large patch of thin film covering the majority of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate lacing is observed.\\n\\nS: There are light aromas of roasted malts but the dominant aroma for this beer is from the wood it was aged in. Light vanilla notes as well. Alcohol can be detected.\\n\\nT: There is a nice complexity to the flavors of this beer with some light amounts caramel sweetness, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, raisin, coffee, and possibly rum. But the dominant flavor is from the wood that it was aged in.\\n\\nM: Medium to full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with alcohol warming in the finish and some light amounts of dryness.\\n\\nO: This beer is pretty easy to drink but you would be better off sipping it - you can more greatly appreciate the subtly of the flavors and the high ABV will really sneak up on you otherwise. There is some light alcohol hints but not nearly as much as you might expect from this strong a beer. Not sessionable.\\xa0',\n",
       " '26': \" abv on the label. After a few weeks in the fridge I finally got around to it and opened it up the same , without a care. I was quite surprised (and excited) to see a rich, very brown stream pouring into my glass. Ruby highlights could been seen through the stream, but when it hit the glass it turned black. A creamy head of dark tan rose up above it. I couldn't help but take a sip before finishing the pour. It was dark, rich, and slightly fruity and slightly nutty. I checked it for clarity... well that was out, I couldn't see through it. The dark ruby highlight at the base of the glass was nice though. \\n\\nOn to the nose. I sniffed it, and then I sniffed it again. Definite dark malts, and some dark malt acidity, kind of like you get in black coffee - not the coffee smell, but something else that to me says acidity. Maybe I just mean a roasted edge. Fruitiness. It's kind of undefineable, but fruitiness is there... melon rind, perhaps some strawberry. There's a little bit of alcohol to it, and that sometimes suggests fruit. I had to sniff again. Some mild caramel.... but kind of almost scorched and crispy caramel. Burnt sugar I guess. A touch of vegetation.... like fresh cut sapling. Maybe the 'sap' smell was what I was picking up as 'acidic'. Chlorofil-like? Yeah, I think to a certain extent. But what about wood? Now that I know it's aged in wood, did I smell any? Yes, I think so, but just a touch. Of course maybe it's a fruity kind of wood? Maybe what I was smelling smells exactly like Palo Santo? I don't know.\\n\\nIn the mouth it was smooth, richly medium in body, with the silky feel of alcohol infused malt. A very fine-bubbled moderate carbonation helped it acquire a velvet creaminess.\\n\\nThe flavor was rich, and somewhat bold, but not really complex. It offered some moderate fruitiness, and distinct alcohol. There was no direct chocolate, but it ricocheted about here and there until some fudge actually appeared in the finish. Then there was some nuttiness, and a wash of alcohol to boot. The chocolate echoed. Deep cocoa. Real milk chocolate. But it was also fruit tinged as that never really left the palate. Nutiness, and the bitterness of brazil nut skins appeared. I hadn't really thought of the bitterness... up until that point it was just about the maltiness and fruitiness. I guess that's because the bitterness is kept restrained. There's enough alcohol available to dry it in the finish that a solid bitterness isn't needed. And such a dark beer has cutting acidity as well. So - nicely balanced overall. And the hops that are there seem to be covered over, but mainly leafy and grassy, and perhaps a touch spicy (although I think that's the alcohol making itself known).\\n\\nInteresting? Yes. Enjoyable? Yes. Remarkable? No. I'd much rather have an ImmortAle or World Wide Stout for the price.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '27': 'On tap in Greenville, SC. \\nOpaque dark brown body with a decent beige head.\\nA generous amount of dark roasted grains helps this achieve partially hidden alcohol.\\nAlcohol is obvious, but not quite harsh, in the feel, and the flavor is more than a touch boozy: just enough to hur my ratings on both dimensions.\\xa0',\n",

The smell of the beer is full of wood that this beer is aged on. The aroma is also kind of sweet smelling and rich with brown sugar I think. The taste of the beer is a big, it's got some of the biggest flavors I've ever had from a brown ale. There is the wood flavors, some dark fruits and a touch of coffee in there. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, decent carbonation and oily.

Of course I had already read it via BeerAdvocate, but appreciated the gestures nonetheless. So when I saw this on the shelf in downtown Vancouver last month, I procured a bottle for each of them (to share with me, of course). The first one vanished none too slowly, so I had better write this one down...\\n\\nThis beer pours a deep, dark black, with reddish tints, and a single finger of tan head, that disappears readily. The smell is prunes, dates, and an intense wood essence, that I admit I cannot identify (beyond the description on the label). The taste is floral hops, heavy black fruit, caramel, vanilla, and an acrid woodiness, again hard to describe. The carbonation is quite low, and the finish carries on the heavy woody sweetness. The body is very thick and viscous, with obvious alcohol warming. It sticks to the palate, making this a slow, if exotically tasty tipple.\\xa0', '11': \"I've never had a 4-pack to come wiht a CD before. I thought I was getting a deal with Left Hand 6-packs with the free sticker. Our homebrew club recently brewed an Imperial Brown and aged it in a Four Roses Bourbon Barrel for the '08 NHC. Interesting to compare the differences. This beer surely qualifies for a Double Brown without loosing any balance, falling into Porter or Stout territory. A nice chocolaty, nutty flavor with a hearty helping of malt, sweetness, and berry-like esters. Good hopping rates give the beer a grassy, piney flavor while offsetting the heavy sweetness. The wood gives a well-roundness to the flavors, but don't give a whole lot of wood flavor or astringency. Quite delicate in it's balance, despite a dominant alcohol (ethanol)taste and slightly harsh textures, but does thin the weighted brew a bit. Surprised to see a fizzy head formation that didn't last any time at all, nor did the carbination -- strange for DFH.\\xa0\", '12': \"Another Dogfish head beer. Hmm. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with botled on date 02/02/2011B. What does the B mean? I don't know. Served into a De Molen beer stemflute in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. I don't know what to expect, but when I think of a brown think nuts. Wood aging isn't anywhere near what I'd expect, and I'm hoping it'll blow me away. Served slightly warmer than refrigerator cold. \\n\\nA: Pours a 1.5 finger head of rich light tan colour, good cream, great thickness, and very impressive retention - especially considering the 12.00% ABV. Wow. Colour is a solid black (NOT brown). I'm impressed so far, and excited to try it. \\n\\nSm: A moderately strong aroma of cream, wood, nuts, birch, vanilla, caramel, and a hint of alcohol. I wouldn't call it subtle, nor is it particularly inviting. No yeast comes through. \\n\\nT: The wood comes through, but only on the finish. The warm alcohol is well-restrained and hidden, hardly coming through at all. I get vanilla, light caramel, very buried roasted barley (why this is buried is beyond me), and nuts - but only on the climax. It isn't subtle, but instead feels muted; I find myself straining to taste each note because the holistic flavour doesn't have all that much to offer. I mean it's good, and it's balanced, but it just doesn't bring the depth or boldness I'd expect from a 12% beer. This may be the least flavorful high ABV beer I've had in the last three months. \\n\\nMf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours and general tone of the beer. Not too thick nor too thin. Actually surprisingly well done. \\n\\nDr: Extremely drinkable for the ABV, but where is the flavour? Hit us with the taste if you believe it's a good one! I like this, but I wouldn't have it again because it's kind of a panzy when it comes to delivering on the promise of the aroma. Shame on you Dogfish Head! \\n\\nB-\\xa0\", '13': 'Bottle from the first release, found in the back of the fridge. \\nLess than a finger of head when poured into a Duchesse goblet. Tan foam that recedes slowly, and leaves a ring. Lactic aroma with some banana ester from the yeast, and slightly roasty. Reminds me of a Bells stout. Rich, creamy feel, earthy roast and lactic taste. Not getting much of the advertised wood-aging. Abv is well disguised. Similar to Bells Kalamazoo Stout or Double Cream. Good, but not worth paying a premium for.\\xa0', '14': \"Poured from a bottle into my Chimay goblet. This bottle has been in my cellar for a year.\\n\\nAppearance: Pours almost black with some red at the edges where the light comes through. There is a half finger of tan head that fades quickly.\\n\\nSmell: Sweet, which isn't surprising. Dark fruit and brown sugar notes. Mild roast and a hint of wood. Some alcohol as well.\\n\\nTaste: Extremely smooth given the abv. Not very sweet, but there are hints of dark fruit and chocolate. The palo santo wood adds some complexity. The finish is still a bit hot even with a year on it.\\n\\nMouthfeel: The body is on the thick side of medium body. The carbonation is fluffy and smooth. The finish is mildly slick.\\n\\nOverall: The fact that this isn't overly sweet really surprised me. I thought it was complex and very interesting. The year of aging was good for this beer, but it is still a bit hot.\\xa0\", '15': \"Appearance: Looks almost like a RIS, although the color might be a tone or two lighter as ruby highlights clearly burst through; the head fades quickly to an espresso cap and leaves a few dots and dashes of lace around the glass\\n\\nSmell: Complex aromas from a variety of sources, including dark fruit, fusel alcohol, molasses and chocolate and, of course, a heavy dose of smokey wood esters\\n\\nTaste: Opens with a rich black bread and caramel/vanilla flavor that moves in a dark fruit and smokey, woody direction by mid-palate, with a bit a black currant jam providing additional sweetness; after the swallow, the chocolate and coffee flavors enter and provide a roasty bitterness that counters the sweet flavors that dominated earlier in the taste profile; the smokey wood sticks around long after the finish\\n\\nMouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; clearly some warmth from the high abv as well\\n\\nDrinkability: I love Dogfish Head's experimental efforts and this beer is among the best they have released, if not the best\\xa0\", 'Beer_Name': 'Palo Santo Marron', 'Brewery_Name': 'Dogfish Head Craft Brewery', 'ABV': '12.00', 'Type': 'American Brown Ale', '20': \"A - Poured out a dark, reddish brown color with a thick, foamy, tan head that left soapy trails of lace.\\n\\nS - It smelled of oak, vanilla and rich, sweet, caramel malt.\\n\\nT - It has an incredibly sweet maltiness with underlying hints of vanilla. Also, a whiskey-like flavor.\\n\\nM - It was crisp, yet soft as it warmed. A medium-bodied beer.\\n\\nD - Despite the high ABV, this is a fairly easy-drinking beer. One of the more unique brown ales that I've ever had.\\xa0\", '21': 'Bottle courtesy of Jay23: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing. Aroma of vanilla and oak is pretty pleasant with some light roasted malt notes. Taste is a mix between some roasted malt notes with a mix of vanilla and oak and some creamy lactose notes. Full creamy body is really enjoyable with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done and probably one of the best new seasonal from Dogfish.\\xa0', '22': '12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2012. Pours almost pitch black color with a small foamy dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the small head. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, fig, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, light char, wood, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and wood aging notes. Taste of big raisin, fig, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, light char, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of very robust dark malt flavors with fruitiness; and hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial brown ale. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.\\xa0', '23': \"Appearance - Nearly opaque dark brown with a creamy cap of coffee-colored foam.\\n\\nSmell - Molasses, vanilla, maple syrup. Slightly burnt toast. Sweet without being cloying.\\n\\nTaste & mouthfeel - Rich roasty malt, vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate. The mouthfeel is chewy, almost like a liquid molasses cookie. Quite a bit of subtle complexity; I've had this a couple of times now and I'm still not entirely sure how to describe it. A nice toasty bitterness in the finish balances the initial sweetness. This is a true imperial brown - it retains the character of a brown ale without ever dipping into stout territory. Remarkably drinkable for 12%. A solid DFH offering.\\xa0\", '24': ' abv american brown ale :) This beer has a year or two of age on it.\\n\\nPoured into Bud American Ale glass\\n\\nPours 1/2 finger of mocha tan head.

This is one of the tops in the category for me. Aging it was a good idea.\\n\\nMouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, and simply wonderful. Medium to full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Hardly any heat with this beer which is great. Only downfall is that it ends fairly dry.\\n\\nOverall, this beer is great. Tons of flavor. This is a new favorite of mine. I will definitely be getting more to cellar. Pretty drinkable and a fine taste to it. I highly recommend.\\xa0', '25': 'A: Pours an opaque jet black in color. The beer has a finger tall tan head that reduces to a large patch of thin film covering the majority of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate lacing is observed.\\n\\nS: There are light aromas of roasted malts but the dominant aroma for this beer is from the wood it was aged in. Light vanilla notes as well. Alcohol can be detected.\\n\\nT: There is a nice complexity to the flavors of this beer with some light amounts caramel sweetness, vanilla, bittersweet chocolate, raisin, coffee, and possibly rum. But the dominant flavor is from the wood that it was aged in.\\n\\nM: Medium to full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with alcohol warming in the finish and some light amounts of dryness.\\n\\nO: This beer is pretty easy to drink but you would be better off sipping it - you can more greatly appreciate the subtly of the flavors and the high ABV will really sneak up on you otherwise. There is some light alcohol hints but not nearly as much as you might expect from this strong a beer. Not sessionable.\\xa0', '26': \" abv on the label. After a few weeks in the fridge I finally got around to it and opened it up the same , without a care. I was quite surprised (and excited) to see a rich, very brown stream pouring into my glass. Ruby highlights could been seen through the stream, but when it hit the glass it turned black. A creamy head of dark tan rose up above it. I couldn't help but take a sip before finishing the pour. It was dark, rich, and slightly fruity and slightly nutty. I checked it for clarity... well that was out, I couldn't see through it. The dark ruby highlight at the base of the glass was nice though. \\n\\nOn to the nose. I sniffed it, and then I sniffed it again. Definite dark malts, and some dark malt acidity, kind of like you get in black coffee - not the coffee smell, but something else that to me says acidity. Maybe I just mean a roasted edge. Fruitiness. It's kind of undefineable, but fruitiness is there... melon rind, perhaps some strawberry. There's a little bit of alcohol to it, and that sometimes suggests fruit. I had to sniff again. Some mild caramel.... but kind of almost scorched and crispy caramel. Burnt sugar I guess. A touch of vegetation.... like fresh cut sapling. Maybe the 'sap' smell was what I was picking up as 'acidic'. Chlorofil-like? Yeah, I think to a certain extent. But what about wood? Now that I know it's aged in wood, did I smell any? Yes, I think so, but just a touch. Of course maybe it's a fruity kind of wood? Maybe what I was smelling smells exactly like Palo Santo? I don't know.\\n\\nIn the mouth it was smooth, richly medium in body, with the silky feel of alcohol infused malt. A very fine-bubbled moderate carbonation helped it acquire a velvet creaminess.\\n\\nThe flavor was rich, and somewhat bold, but not really complex. It offered some moderate fruitiness, and distinct alcohol. There was no direct chocolate, but it ricocheted about here and there until some fudge actually appeared in the finish. Then there was some nuttiness, and a wash of alcohol to boot. The chocolate echoed. Deep cocoa. Real milk chocolate. But it was also fruit tinged as that never really left the palate. Nutiness, and the bitterness of brazil nut skins appeared. I hadn't really thought of the bitterness... up until that point it was just about the maltiness and fruitiness. I guess that's because the bitterness is kept restrained. There's enough alcohol available to dry it in the finish that a solid bitterness isn't needed. And such a dark beer has cutting acidity as well. So - nicely balanced overall. And the hops that are there seem to be covered over, but mainly leafy and grassy, and perhaps a touch spicy (although I think that's the alcohol making itself known).\\n\\nInteresting? Yes. Enjoyable? Yes. Remarkable? No. I'd much rather have an ImmortAle or World Wide Stout for the price.\\xa0\", '27': 'On tap in Greenville, SC. \\nOpaque dark brown body with a decent beige head.\\nA generous amount of dark roasted grains helps this achieve partially hidden alcohol.\\nAlcohol is obvious, but not quite harsh, in the feel, and the flavor is more than a touch boozy: just enough to hur my ratings on both dimensions.\\xa0', '28': 'Had on tap at Dive Bar in Worcester.\\n\\nBig rich creamy head fades slowly with nice thick lacing dark mahogany molases brown color.\\n\\nNose of lots of dark malts almost like an old ale, plenty of crystal, little roast, brown sugar and molasses but all wit re gentle aged malt aroma. Also some light oak aromas, the unique Palo Santo wood.\\n\\nTastes is fairly sweet with lots of malts again, some creamy even, brown sugar and light molasses, toffee, slight chewy malts and little roast. Again the subtle gentle aged malt flavor. Very light warming booze. Some light bitterness and very mild grassy hop character.

Finishes creamy and little drier but mildly sweet with lingering malts and oak and a bit of bitterness.\\n\\nMouth is fairly full bodied with a creamy texture and good carbonation.\\n\\nDrinkability is pretty good for 12% abv as it drinks like 7% and some mild light sticky finish but mostly clean and bit of lingering hops.\\xa0', '29': \"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.\\n\\nA: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a very thin light brown head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.\\n\\nS: The aroma is of roasted malts, vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, a touch of dark fruit and a touch of hops.\\n\\nT: The taste is very smoky up front with sweet flavors of caramel, vanilla and chocolate. There's a hearty stout-like malt character and a mild but complimentary hops presence. The high 12.00% ABV is well-disguised. The after-taste is slightly sweet.\\n\\nM: Crisp and smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish.\\n\\nD: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style while leaning toward being a stout.
