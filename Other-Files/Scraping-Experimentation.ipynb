Looks-wise this one isn't so bad I must say. Smell is of subtle grain, sugar, and metal. There is also a weird fruitiness that I am picking up in the smell. Taste is of sugary water and slight grain flavors. This beer seems to be quite flat with a watery quality in the mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty horrible beer any way you look at it. I am glad I picked up a can to try just so I can further appreciate all the good beer I am able to enjoy.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '10': \"Beer 30 Light has a thick, egg-shell colored head and a clear, golden appearance with some bubbles streaming up and little lacing left. The aroma is strange, to say the least, with a green sour apple scent and other smells I can't detect. The taste is also peculiar, with that sour green apple aspect and other funny flavors I just cannot place. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Beer 30 Light finishes crisp, refreshing, and dry. This is a beer worth trying, because it's so unusual.\\n\\nRJT\\xa0\",\n",
       " '11': \"Can, graciously shared at the July Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a sickly yellowish straw color, evoking images of corn cob aged hose water, with a sputtering gray head. It could be power of suggestion with the laughable purple can, or it could be a really weird gross fermentation, but I'm getting some distinct grape notes on the nose. Beyond that, maybe some rotting grains. Flavor thankfully eases up on the fruit solvent and retreats into your basic dirty pale lager with dusty corny grains and a vanishing unsavory finish. Carbonation is surprisingly low for the style, giving a tap watery impression. No reason to ever drink this even for free. Well, the tick is worth it.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '12': \"24oz TALLboy can poured into a 1L Spaten mug!! Set me back a buck, I couldn't resist!\\n\\nPale, straw colored clear liquid fell into the mug forming a couple of fingers of puffy white head that dwindled down to a soapy film on the top. \\n\\nNothing much on the aroma aside from some corny sweetness and metal (admittedly I'd say not from the can...just that metallic crap lager taste)\\n\\nLight grainy, corny sweetness. It's palatable, but if it had a fraction more sweetness to it, it'd be cloying. \\n\\nSlightly crisp, light, but has a heavier, creamy feel which is nice, but for the style, a crisper bite would have been more refreshing.\\n\\nOverall, not hard to put back. I don't know really if I was taking huge gulps because it was easy, or I was ready to move on to a KBS or something!\\xa0\",\n",
       " '13': 'Appearance: Clear medium golden in color, with a small, snow-white head of coarse bubbles and which resembles soap foam. The carbonation ia profuse, fast-rising and composed of rather large bubbles. The lacing is slight and scattered.\\n\\nAroma; Cooked corn dominates the aroma, there are faint metallic hops, a mineral note, and a bit of alcohol.\\n\\nTaste: Opens with a bit of tart malt, this slightly sour flavor, along with a modest white bread flavor, carries throughout. Late in the taste, a ghostly metallic hop note appears, bringing the taste to a close.\\n\\nMouth feel: Soft, thin, watery, with a bit of stinging carbonation.\\n\\nDrinkability/notes: An average example of the style. At sixty-nine cents a can, it is hard to complain.\\n\\nPresentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a standard Pilsener glass\\xa0',\n",
       " '14': \"A - Clear golden color with a slightly than larger, foamy, rocky, sticky, white head. Retention is below average and settles into a thin ring of lace. Similar to other mass produced light lagers.\\n\\nS - Very faint and thin. Some grain and corn aroma that is similar to other light lagers. Some mineral aroma as well. Not great.\\n\\nT - A lot of cooked corn and grain provides most of the flavor. Some mineral and maybe a hint of apple and other fruitiness. Taste kind of like a cheap light lager mixed with a cheap cider.\\n\\nM - Light body with a lot of carbonation. Typical to the style.\\n\\nD - Not really all that drinkable. Taste isn't great and it doesn't refresh as much as other macro made light lagers.\\n\\nNotes: Not really all that great of a beer and shows that you get what you pay for. I'll probably stick to PBR or Miller High Life for my cheap beer, but if you want a bit more of a fruitiness in your cheap beer, this may be for you. Plus the label/name is kind of funny.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '15': '30 pack was $12... That\\'s the cheapest beer available in Lake of the Ozarks MO, and craft beer is pretty dismal.... I figured if I had to drink swill, it may as well be the cheapest swill... That was a mistake. \\n\\nA dark yellow color that fizzes up a one finger white head-- almost seltzer water like. The head is gone very quickly, like it bubbled itself away. No lacing. \\nWow. The word \"bad\" doesn\\'t do this beer justice. This smells like a lemon solvent, with a hint of sourmash corn. \\n\\nThe taste is generic sweetness, like corn syrup or sugar, followed by a sour lemon note that could be from a sourmash or from an interesting hop procedure. \\n\\nBody feels undercarbonated for the style. Kinda thick and syrupy. \\n\\nOverall, this is terrible. I have 29 more of these??!! FML. \\nI need to set up a trade with WoodyChandler-- maybe he CAN help me out here...\\xa0',\n",
       " '2': 'Poured from a 12oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.\\n\\nA: The beer is a very light yellow color, with a short white head that fades very quickly and leaves very little lace on the glass. \\n\\nS: The aroma is of adjuncts, very light malts and almost no hops.\\n\\nT: The taste starts with an adjunct and light malt sweetness that is followed by a thin grain breadiness. The hops presence is nearly undetectable. The after-taste is slightly sweet.\\n\\nM: Watery, light body, medium-to-high carbonation, finish is clean.\\n\\nD: Almost no flavor at all, goes down easily and is not too filling since there isn\\'t much to it, very mild kick, I don\\'t see how they can honestly call this \"Premium Beer\" on the can when it barely passes for beer at all.\\xa0',\n",
       " '3': \"CAN you dig it? I pulled off a major trade in the Heinz Field parking lot a couple of weeks ago before watching Pitt lose (by a missed PAT!) to Cincy. I think that I developed a slight head cold during the snowy weather and so my reviews got put on hold until my sinuses cleared. Let the CAN Quest continue!\\n\\nI totally get the concept of this beer - it is always Beer:30 when I get home from a day of teaching. I just wish that I could have tried its leaded counterpart first. Onward!\\n\\nI must be slipping - my pour only produced a little better than a finger's worth of bone-white head with really low retention. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. It looked like sunshine in a glass as I peered into the gloaming through my kitchen window. The nose was sweet, mostly cereal, but also some of that fruity bubblegum. Oof. Mouthfeel was fuller than I might expect in a light beer, but that did not help the cloyingly sweet taste I got on the tongue. Double oof. The finish left me wondering how many more of these kinds of beers I am going to encounter on the CANQuest. I CAN only hope that more craft brewers turn to CANs in the near future.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '4': 'Also from the 99 cent store.\\n\\nA: This one pours a pale straw color with a minimal white head forming. Already not living up to Beer 30 Ice...\\n\\nS: Rotten vegetables is the best way I can think to describe this aroma. A bit of garbage and paper is also there. Sure, plenty of corn, sugar, and metal, too.\\n\\nT: Very corny and vegetal. Lots of sweet apple juice flavor and a nice metallic note. Mildly sour and lemony. Though not intense, the flavor is certainly abrasive.\\n\\nM: Light in body with a medium to high carbonation.\\n\\nO: Somehow, worse than Beer 30 Ice.\\xa0',\n",
       " '5': 'Served in a Chicago Bears shaker pint glass.\\n\\nThanks to my buddy and his Iowa City-based alma mater, I now have a case o\\' this. Yeah. It pours a clear deep sallow topped by a rather short-lived bit o\\' fizzy white foam. The nose is nearly as devoid of scent as the surface of the moon (since, according to my research, the moon\\'s not really made of cheese (seriously? when did this happen!?), I figure it\\'s pretty scent-less), with only some mild corn chaff finding it\\'s way into the \\'strils. The taste doesn\\'t try too hard to one-up the smell, though a very mild sweetness vainly tries to pervade the otherwise tasteless liquid. As my boy Filbert once said, this thing went down \"like a lead rake\". Interestingly, the body is very light, with a fizzy carbonation and a watery feel. So...I guess it\\'s more apt to say it went down too easily...like...a lead rake...? Why not? Overall, I really don\\'t want to drink this. It\\'s not that it\\'s completely offensive, per se, but it\\'s not a flavor of water I really want to have much of. As far as I\\'m concerned, I hope the clock never strikes Beer:30 so long as it means this brew is in the offing.\\xa0',\n",
       " '6': \"A- Half inch of a fizzy white head on a clear, very pale body. Low head retention properties and no lacing.\\n\\nS- Not a pleasant smell although I don't know what it is akin too. light lemon zest perhaps.\\n\\nT- Weird, semi-metallic fruity aftertaste...up until that point not bad at all. Easy drinking besides that.\\n\\nM- Feels good in the mouth for the style. Medium bodies, high carbonation. Best feature of Beer 30 Light.\\n\\nD/O- If they could get rid of that off-putting taste at the end of each gulp this could be a winner (read: average). As it stands now, the best thing I took out of this 24 ouncer was a can tick.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '7': 'Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by corn. Taste is like water with a touch of beer flavoring. Not much going on at all. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall there is nothing to recomend about this beer.\\xa0',\n",
       " '8': \"A-Pours the generic straw yellow with a thin foamy head. \\n\\nS-Quite an unattractive smell, even for the style. Just very skunky and a bit too much. If I am drinking a cheap thirty (and this one is cheap!) then I want it to be pretty nondescript. This has a bit too much.\\n\\nT-Even for a light lager, this one is just off. Hard to put down these at a quick rate. Just a mess.\\n\\nM-A bit too heavy for a crappy light beer. Need this to be more watery for maximum drunken consumption.\\n\\nO/D-The only good part about this beer is that it is the cheapest thirty I have seen in MA. It ran about $13 and I respect the gimmick they're going for here. Really gross, but hey, its cheap and eventually gets the job done...eventually.\\xa0\",\n",
       " '9': 'Two ways to consider this: I have enough of a sense of humor about beer to drop 2.50 on a six pack of a beer that seems to market itself as something horrible, with its gaudy purple can and, well, name. \"Beer\" is all it says. \"30 Light\" is much smaller. That\\'s kind of funny.\\n\\nThe other way is that I\\'m an idiot who just bought something that is marketed as being horrible and I should expect any pain that this brew may cause me.\\n\\nTepid pour. Very light yellow with a small, very short-lived head.\\n\\nSmells at first of nothing. When it warms it takes on the absolutely repugnant odor of a can of a regular bad macro that\\'s been sitting for a few days. Ya\\'know, that smell of week old Bud. Well, this was opened ten minutes ago and it smells like that.\\n\\nTastes...not half bad, actually. A little metal but a surpising amount of fruit esters, especially for a light lager. Seriously, if the smell wasn\\'t so goddamn horrible this would be a top notch light. Erm... okay as it warms it starts to taste like it smells. \\n\\nOh, and it should also work on the mournful dispepsia it causes. And the headache.\\xa0'}"
